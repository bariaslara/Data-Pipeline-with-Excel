# Data-Pipeline-with-Excel
An automated data pipeline for processing and filtering product data from CSV files, integrated with Excel for easy execution and results logging.

## About the Project

This project is a **data pipeline** built to process and analyze product data using Python. The pipeline automates the following tasks:

- **Data Extraction**: Reads product-related CSV files from a designated directory.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that product transaction dates are processed correctly and only includes transactions on or before a given date.
- **Results Logging**: Appends the filtered product data (transaction ID and date) to a results file in CSV format.
- **Automated Execution**: The script integrates with an Excel sheet through `xlwings`, allowing users to execute it via a button in the spreadsheet.
  
### Key Features:
- **Date Filtering**: The script reads CSV data and filters out product transactions based on a given cutoff date, ensuring only relevant records are processed.
- **Automated Excel Integration**: The project is designed to be run from an Excel workbook, making it easy for users to execute the script and view results in a familiar interface.
- **Customizable for Different Use Cases**: The script is adaptable, allowing for easy modifications to fit various business scenarios and data structures.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The core language for scripting and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For handling data structures and date conversions.
- **CSV**: For input/output data in CSV format.
- **xlwings**: To integrate Python scripts with Excel for user-friendly execution.
- **Datetime**: For working with date comparisons and timestamps.
